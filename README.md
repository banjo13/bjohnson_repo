# ESS590DataSci
Repo for UW ESS 590 Data Science Course
This repo will be used for the final project. 

There are two .csv files located in /util/ that contain the velocity models, brem_EikoNet_P.csv is P wave velocity and brem_EikoNet_S.csv is S wave velocity. 

We need to change the database.py file to be able to read the .csv files accordingly. 

I am working on setting up the code in a jupyter notebook. I will add that, and all of the additional information for the project as well.
